Now Ive been a huge Sketchers Go Walk fan for some time and the only reason I tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
These shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).
If you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
The material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. My feet do not feel hot in them.

I don't know if they just needed to be broken in, but I wear them all the time now and have not experienced any pain since the first couple times of wearing them.

Now Ive been a huge Sketchers Go Walk fan for some time and the only reason I tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
These shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).
If you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
The material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. My feet do not feel hot in them.
Now these shoes are ideal for a basic workout or cross training, I would not get them to do 25,000 steps in Walt Disney World.

Now Ive been a huge Sketchers Go Walk fan for some time and the only reason I tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
These shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).
If you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
The material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. My feet do not feel hot in them.

I tried these shoes on in the store before purchasing them on Amazon. They are very lightweight and comfortable. I was surprised how great they felt. I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.

I tried these shoes on in the store before purchasing them on Amazon. They are very lightweight and comfortable. I was surprised how great they felt. I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.

**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them. I don't know if they just needed to be broken in, but I wear them all the time now and have not experienced any pain since the first couple times of wearing them.

Now Ive been a huge Sketchers Go Walk fan for some time and the only reason I tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
These shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).
If you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
The material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. My feet do not feel hot in them.

Now Ive been a huge Sketchers Go Walk fan for some time and the only reason I tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
These shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).
If you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
The material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. My feet do not feel hot in them.

Now Ive been a huge Sketchers Go Walk fan for some time and the only reason I tried these instead of the latest number 4 of those is because the tread looked too slippery to me.
These shoes are very sturdy and the grip of the soles has been very solid so far. I use them for basic workout cardio and cross training, as well as work as a massage therapist (I go through shoes fast enough that Ive recently consolidated).
If you're a Go Walk fan, these do not offer the same level of cushion-comfort as those, HOWEVER, they offer the kind of long-term comfort to make them a durable option.
The material of the shoes seem very durable and the breathable. My feet do not feel hot in them.

I tried these shoes on in the store before purchasing them on Amazon. They are very lightweight and comfortable. I was surprised how great they felt. I haven't had a pair of Nikes since Nike shoxs came out. They are so much more lightweight than those. I wore them an entire day the first day and had no problems. The second day; however, I got a pain in my hip to the point where I started limping. As soon as I got home and took them off, the pain was gone the rest of the evening. I'm only 30 by the way. Nothing else in my daily routine changed except wearing these shoes two days in a row. I don't understand why it would make my hip hurt since they are comfortable on my feet, but I'm sure that was the problem. I wore different shoes today and had no pain. I don't think as much as I am on my feet I will be able to wear them an extended amount of time. I will have to rotate wearing them every other day. For normal wear, I believe, people will be fine. I am literally walking or standing six hours a day straight.

**UPDATE: So, initially after wearing them, I had hip pain after wearing them. I don't know if they just needed to be broken in, but I wear them all the time now and have not experienced any pain since the first couple times of wearing them. They are comfortable, and I love them even more now.",Comfortable and lightweight,1462320000,20,,amazon_fashion

They look good with just about anything, and are comfortable for most situations.
With the exception of running (for which I use proper Mizuno running sneakers with an arch-support insole), these sneakers are my go-to.
If I could, I'd take away a 1/2 star for arch support - I have a slightly wider front of the foot and arches that are a little on the high side, so I do look for a good under the foot fit. I could probably tie the laces differently or put in an insole(they're pretty expensive), but as is, when I did a zumba class in these, my arch began to twinge :(
However, this is overall an awesome shoe that I will continue to stick with for going out, day to day walking, and for training and gym use (with the exception of running and zumba (although hip-hop was fine). The shoes have a great flexibility to them and don't look ""dirty"" easily. My previous pair of flex supreme TR 3s have lasted for a good 2 years and are just now on the verge of being worn out. This is the optimal sneaker that is flexible in more ways than one: from pointing you toes to leg-pressing, from gym use to shopping to adding a sporty edge to a dressy night out, the flex has it all.",Simply Supreme.,1471651200,,,amazon_fashion

I was pleasantly surprised by the sole/tread on these for my circuit training classes, as I couldn't really tell by online pics.  Also pleasantly surprised that these ran ever so slightly bigger than Nike running shoes I use to wear 15+years ago - I always wore one to 1.5 sizes larger in their ""Hurache's""/running shoes, so I was really worried my size 6 would be too small - there is actually more toe room in these shoes than any other size 6 shoe I own (athletic, heel, boot).  But it is the correct amount of room from big toe to edge of shoe for me (an inch or less, I don't want my big toe being jammed into edge of shoe when lunging, jumping, etc.).  Shoes arrived with an odd yellowish color on side of one shoe, but no damage to box, paper lining etc - I was happy that a clorox wipe easily cleaned the shoe and did not discolor any further.

I have sensitive skin, and know that this product is causing the reaction since it only happens when I use this.  While I like the other Mad Hippie products I've tried, I'd stay away from this one if you have skin that is easily irritated.

I recently ordered the Mad Hippie Face Cream, Exfoliating Serum, and Antioxidant Facial Oil, and really like them a lot.  I've only been using them a few days, so I'll be sure to update my review as I use these more, but so far I like the fact that this is a healthier brand, with not many chemicals added to their products.

This Face Cream is not quite hydrating enough for me, but I've found that using the Antioxidant Facial Oil on top helps seal in moisture.

The Mad Hippie website also gives instructions for how to layer their products:

""We recommend gently massaging the vitamin C serum into your skin in the morning after washing and drying thoroughly.  Wait 5 minutes after applying the serum & apply the creams.  Apply the face cream to the entire face, including eye area, then apply the eye cream beside and below the eyesmaking sure to rub both creams in well, particularly around wrinkle prone areas.  Follow this with our extra hydrating antioxidant facial oil.

At night, follow the same steps but replace the vitamin C serum with an exfoliant:  either the exfoliating serum or vitamin A serum.  If just using the creams, wait a couple minutes after washing your face when skin is fully dry to apply. The facial SPF should be used as the final and last step of your morning routine.""",Be careful if you have sensitive skin!,1485043200,6,,all_beauty

I have sensitive skin, and know that this product is causing the reaction since it only happens when I use this.  While I like the other Mad Hippie products I've tried, I'd stay away from this one if you have skin that is easily irritated.  One or more of the ingredients is definitely too strong if you have bad reactions!
-------

I recently ordered the Mad Hippie Face Cream, Exfoliating Serum, and Antioxidant Facial Oil, and really like them a lot.  I've only been using them a few days, so I'll be sure to update my review as I use these more, but so far I like the fact that this is a healthier brand, with not many chemicals added to their products.

This Face Cream is not quite hydrating enough for me, but I've found that using the Antioxidant Facial Oil on top helps seal in moisture.

The Mad Hippie website also gives instructions for how to layer their products:

""We recommend gently massaging the vitamin C serum into your skin in the morning after washing and drying thoroughly.  Wait 5 minutes after applying the serum & apply the creams.  Apply the face cream to the entire face, including eye area, then apply the eye cream beside and below the eyesmaking sure to rub both creams in well, particularly around wrinkle prone areas.  Follow this with our extra hydrating antioxidant facial oil.

At night, follow the same steps but replace the vitamin C serum with an exfoliant:  either the exfoliating serum or vitamin A serum.  If just using the creams, wait a couple minutes after washing your face when skin is fully dry to apply. The facial SPF should be used as the final and last step of your morning routine.""",Be careful if you have sensitive skin!,1485043200,6,,all_beauty

He said the Waterpik does not have enough pressure to remove plaque. This is really just for getting the big chunks of food before I brush and floss with Oral-B Superfloss.
Before I got braces, I occasionally used the Waterpik but I can't say it did much for me.
It has been a year and I have noticed a puddle of water around the Waterpik after I turn it off. I think the handle is now leaking.
After my braces come off I will probably throw the Waterpik away.

The area where the water came out was small and the spray could be directed easily. It did not make a mess. It was fantastic for cleaning my teeth, which had braces.

Now that my son has some orthodontia, the dentist suggested using a WaterPik.

This thing is unbelievable. The spray comes out so fast and the spray is so wide, that it makes a huge mess. Even I, a coordinated adult, have a hard time using this without spraying down the bathroom walls, mirror, and countertop. This is a mess. I am worried the wallpaper will be ruined and will begin peeling off.

Tip: Put the device in the mouth, then turn it on. Try to use it with your mouth closed or nearly closed and shut it off before you remove it from your mouth.

After reading other customer reviews, to prevent possible leakage, we take the unit apart and dump out the water after each usage.

Do your research regarding other models available as well as this one. The customer reviews here on Amazon are eye-opening.

I wish they made the WaterPik like the original ones that lasted for many years and were easier to manage.

Update: One child has been using this for 16 months and it is still functional.

I've been using this for over two months. Before I started I couldn't even get my lashes on a curler. They were that short. Within two and a half weeks I could see a difference. Within a month I could get my lashes on a curler.

This product did make my eyelids itchy. No irritation in my eye though when I accidentally got some in it.  I also noticed a weird looking line above my lahses that is lighter than the rest of my skin.

I've used this as directed.  I did see improvement but I think there is a natural plateau to the lenght and amount of eyelashes that one's DNA will allow. I've hit mine.

The whole family used it for many years. The area where the water came out was small and the spray could be directed easily. It did not make a mess. It was fantastic for cleaning my teeth, which had braces.

Now that my son has some orthodontia, the dentist suggested using a WaterPik.

This thing is unbelievable. The spray comes out so fast and the spray is so wide, that it makes a huge mess. Even I, a coordinated adult, have a hard time using this without spraying down the bathroom walls, mirror, and countertop. This is a mess. I am worried the wallpaper will be ruined and will begin peeling off.

Tip: Put the device in the mouth, then turn it on. Try to use it with your mouth closed or nearly closed and shut it off before you remove it from your mouth.

After reading other customer reviews, to prevent possible leakage, we take the unit apart and dump out the water after each usage.

Do your research regarding other models available as well as this one. The customer reviews here on Amazon are eye-opening.

I wish they made the WaterPik like the original ones that lasted for many years and were easier to manage.

Update: One child has been using this for 16 months and it is still functional.

The whole family used it for many years. The area where the water came out was small and the spray could be directed easily. It did not make a mess. It was fantastic for cleaning my teeth, which had braces.

Now that my son has some orthodontia, the dentist suggested using a WaterPik.

This thing is unbelievable. The spray comes out so fast and the spray is so wide, that it makes a huge mess. Even I, a coordinated adult, have a hard time using this without spraying down the bathroom walls, mirror, and countertop. This is a mess. I am worried the wallpaper will be ruined and will begin peeling off.

Tip: Put the device in the mouth, then turn it on. Try to use it with your mouth closed or nearly closed and shut it off before you remove it from your mouth.

After reading other customer reviews, to prevent possible leakage, we take the unit apart and dump out the water after each usage.

Do your research regarding other models available as well as this one. The customer reviews here on Amazon are eye-opening.

I wish they made the WaterPik like the original ones that lasted for many years and were easier to manage.

The whole family used it for many years. The area where the water came out was small and the spray could be directed easily. It did not make a mess. It was fantastic for cleaning my teeth, which had braces.

Now that my son has some orthodontia, the dentist suggested using a WaterPik.

This thing is unbelievable. The spray comes out so fast and the spray is so wide, that it makes a huge mess. Even I, a coordinated adult, have a hard time using this without spraying down the bathroom walls, mirror, and countertop. This is a mess. I am worried the wallpaper will be ruined and will begin peeling off.

Tip: Put the device in the mouth, then turn it on. Try to use it with your mouth closed or nearly closed and shut it off before you remove it from your mouth.

After reading other customer reviews, to prevent possible leakage, we take the unit apart and dump out the water after each usage.

Do your research regarding other models available as well as this one. The customer reviews here on Amazon are eye-opening.

I wish they made the WaterPik like the original ones that lasted for many years and were easier to manage.

Update: One child has been using this for 16 months and it is still functional.

The whole family used it for many years. The area where the water came out was small and the spray could be directed easily. It did not make a mess. It was fantastic for cleaning my teeth, which had braces.

Now that my son has some orthodontia, the dentist suggested using a WaterPik.

This thing is unbelievable. The spray comes out so fast and the spray is so wide, that it makes a huge mess. Even I, a coordinated adult, have a hard time using this without spraying down the bathroom walls, mirror, and countertop. This is a mess. I am worried the wallpaper will be ruined and will begin peeling off.

Tip: Put the device in the mouth, then turn it on. Try to use it with your mouth closed or nearly closed and shut it off before you remove it from your mouth.

After reading other customer reviews, to prevent possible leakage, we take the unit apart and dump out the water after each usage.

Do your research regarding other models available as well as this one. The customer reviews here on Amazon are eye-opening.

I wish they made the WaterPik like the original ones that lasted for many years and were easier to manage.

Update: One child has been using this for 16 months and it is still functional.

Note on my star rating: For effectiveness for the job I'd rate it 5 = I Love It but for the mess I rate it a 1 = I Hate It which averages out to 3 star rating = It's okay.",What a mess! Not the same as the original!,1189209600,30,,all_beauty

The whole family used it for many years. The area where the water came out was small and the spray could be directed easily. It did not make a mess. It was fantastic for cleaning my teeth, which had braces.

Now that my son has some orthodontia, the dentist suggested using a WaterPik.

This thing is unbelievable. The spray comes out so fast and the spray is so wide, that it makes a huge mess. Even I, a coordinated adult, have a hard time using this without spraying down the bathroom walls, mirror, and countertop. This is a mess. I am worried the wallpaper will be ruined and will begin peeling off.

Tip: Put the device in the mouth, then turn it on. Try to use it with your mouth closed or nearly closed and shut it off before you remove it from your mouth.

After reading other customer reviews, to prevent possible leakage, we take the unit apart and dump out the water after each usage.

Do your research regarding other models available as well as this one. The customer reviews here on Amazon are eye-opening.

I wish they made the WaterPik like the original ones that lasted for many years and were easier to manage.

Update: One child has been using this for 16 months and it is still functional.

Note on my star rating: For effectiveness for the job I'd rate it 5 = I Love It but for the mess I rate it a 1 = I Hate It which averages out to 3 star rating = It's okay.",What a mess! Not the same as the original!,1189209600,30,,all_beauty

The whole family used it for many years. The area where the water came out was small and the spray could be directed easily. It did not make a mess. It was fantastic for cleaning my teeth, which had braces.

Now that my son has some orthodontia, the dentist suggested using a WaterPik.

This thing is unbelievable. The spray comes out so fast and the spray is so wide, that it makes a huge mess. Even I, a coordinated adult, have a hard time using this without spraying down the bathroom walls, mirror, and countertop. This is a mess. I am worried the wallpaper will be ruined and will begin peeling off.

Tip: Put the device in the mouth, then turn it on. Try to use it with your mouth closed or nearly closed and shut it off before you remove it from your mouth.

After reading other customer reviews, to prevent possible leakage, we take the unit apart and dump out the water after each usage.

Do your research regarding other models available as well as this one. The customer reviews here on Amazon are eye-opening.

I wish they made the WaterPik like the original ones that lasted for many years and were easier to manage.

Update: One child has been using this for 16 months and it is still functional.

The area where the water came out was small and the spray could be directed easily. It did not make a mess. It was fantastic for cleaning my teeth, which had braces.

Now that my son has some orthodontia, the dentist suggested using a WaterPik.

This thing is unbelievable. The spray comes out so fast and the spray is so wide, that it makes a huge mess. Even I, a coordinated adult, have a hard time using this without spraying down the bathroom walls, mirror, and countertop. This is a mess. I am worried the wallpaper will be ruined and will begin peeling off.

Tip: Put the device in the mouth, then turn it on. Try to use it with your mouth closed or nearly closed and shut it off before you remove it from your mouth.

After reading other customer reviews, to prevent possible leakage, we take the unit apart and dump out the water after each usage.

Do your research regarding other models available as well as this one. The customer reviews here on Amazon are eye-opening.

I wish they made the WaterPik like the original ones that lasted for many years and were easier to manage.

Update: One child has been using this for 16 months and it is still functional.

The area where the water came out was small and the spray could be directed easily. It did not make a mess. It was fantastic for cleaning my teeth, which had braces.

Now that my son has some orthodontia, the dentist suggested using a WaterPik.

This thing is unbelievable. The spray comes out so fast and the spray is so wide, that it makes a huge mess. Even I, a coordinated adult, have a hard time using this without spraying down the bathroom walls, mirror, and countertop. This is a mess. I am worried the wallpaper will be ruined and will begin peeling off.

2.0,True,"09 8, 2007",A3SMR4HRFJARSC,B000FOI48G,,ChristineMM,"When I was a child our family bought the first WaterPik that came onto the market. The whole family used it for many years. The area where the water came out was small and the spray could be directed easily. It did not make a mess. It was fantastic for cleaning my teeth, which had braces.

Now that my son has some orthodontia, the dentist suggested using a WaterPik.

This thing is unbelievable. The spray comes out so fast and the spray is so wide, that it makes a huge mess. Even I, a coordinated adult, have a hard time using this without spraying down the bathroom walls, mirror, and countertop. This is a mess. I am worried the wallpaper will be ruined and will begin peeling off.

Tip: Put the device in the mouth, then turn it on. Try to use it with your mouth closed or nearly closed and shut it off before you remove it from your mouth.

After reading other customer reviews, to prevent possible leakage, we take the unit apart and dump out the water after each usage.

Do your research regarding other models available as well as this one. The customer reviews here on Amazon are eye-opening.

I wish they made the WaterPik like the original ones that lasted for many years and were easier to manage.

Update: One child has been using this for 16 months and it is still functional.

2.0,True,"09 8, 2007",A3SMR4HRFJARSC,B000FOI48G,,ChristineMM,"When I was a child our family bought the first WaterPik that came onto the market. The whole family used it for many years. The area where the water came out was small and the spray could be directed easily. It did not make a mess. It was fantastic for cleaning my teeth, which had braces.

Now that my son has some orthodontia, the dentist suggested using a WaterPik.

This thing is unbelievable. The spray comes out so fast and the spray is so wide, that it makes a huge mess. Even I, a coordinated adult, have a hard time using this without spraying down the bathroom walls, mirror, and countertop. This is a mess. I am worried the wallpaper will be ruined and will begin peeling off.

Tip: Put the device in the mouth, then turn it on. Try to use it with your mouth closed or nearly closed and shut it off before you remove it from your mouth.

After reading other customer reviews, to prevent possible leakage, we take the unit apart and dump out the water after each usage.

Do your research regarding other models available as well as this one. The customer reviews here on Amazon are eye-opening.

I wish they made the WaterPik like the original ones that lasted for many years and were easier to manage.

Update: One child has been using this for 16 months and it is still functional.

Note on my star rating: For effectiveness for the job I'd rate it 5 = I Love It but for the mess I rate it a 1 = I Hate It which averages out to 3 star rating = It's okay.",What a mess! Not the same as the original!,1189209600,30,,all_beauty

After looking at all the models, we choose this one. It holds a lot of water. It has storage in the lid for all the attachments, and it seemed easy to use.

I looked at the ones that were battery powered but I didn't think they would hold enough water and I couldn't see him refilling it to finish. This model has a big range of pressure that changes quickly with the turn of a dial. it does have to be plugged in and the handle is connected by a water tube. This does limit the distance from the unit to the mouth but it is more than enough if you are standing at a vanity.

There is a huge variety of tips but I don't think we will be using more than two or three. I actually wish that there were two or three of the basic tips for multiple family members instead of some of the other fancy tips.

The tips pop on and off easily and there is a 'pause' button on the handle that allow you to shut the water spray off quickly. This way, you can turn it on, position it in your mouth and then start the water spray.

It is not a clean process. It is almost impossible to use this without splashing water at some point.

The bottom line is that it does what it promises and my son has been using it. We'll see how good his teeth are when the braces come off in two years...",Good Waterpik with lots of Nozzle Choices,1320537600,,,all_beauty

After looking at all the models, we choose this one. It holds a lot of water. It has storage in the lid for all the attachments, and it seemed easy to use.

I looked at the ones that were battery powered but I didn't think they would hold enough water and I couldn't see him refilling it to finish. This model has a big range of pressure that changes quickly with the turn of a dial. it does have to be plugged in and the handle is connected by a water tube. This does limit the distance from the unit to the mouth but it is more than enough if you are standing at a vanity.

There is a huge variety of tips but I don't think we will be using more than two or three. I actually wish that there were two or three of the basic tips for multiple family members instead of some of the other fancy tips.

The tips pop on and off easily and there is a 'pause' button on the handle that allow you to shut the water spray off quickly. This way, you can turn it on, position it in your mouth and then start the water spray.

It is not a clean process. It is almost impossible to use this without splashing water at some point.

The bottom line is that it does what it promises and my son has been using it. We'll see how good his teeth are when the braces come off in two years...",Good Waterpik with lots of Nozzle Choices,1320537600,,,all_beauty

After looking at all the models, we choose this one. It holds a lot of water. It has storage in the lid for all the attachments, and it seemed easy to use.

I looked at the ones that were battery powered but I didn't think they would hold enough water and I couldn't see him refilling it to finish. This model has a big range of pressure that changes quickly with the turn of a dial. it does have to be plugged in and the handle is connected by a water tube. This does limit the distance from the unit to the mouth but it is more than enough if you are standing at a vanity.

There is a huge variety of tips but I don't think we will be using more than two or three. I actually wish that there were two or three of the basic tips for multiple family members instead of some of the other fancy tips.

The tips pop on and off easily and there is a 'pause' button on the handle that allow you to shut the water spray off quickly. This way, you can turn it on, position it in your mouth and then start the water spray.

It is not a clean process. It is almost impossible to use this without splashing water at some point.

After looking at all the models, we choose this one. It holds a lot of water. It has storage in the lid for all the attachments, and it seemed easy to use.

I looked at the ones that were battery powered but I didn't think they would hold enough water and I couldn't see him refilling it to finish. This model has a big range of pressure that changes quickly with the turn of a dial. it does have to be plugged in and the handle is connected by a water tube. This does limit the distance from the unit to the mouth but it is more than enough if you are standing at a vanity.

There is a huge variety of tips but I don't think we will be using more than two or three. I actually wish that there were two or three of the basic tips for multiple family members instead of some of the other fancy tips.

The tips pop on and off easily and there is a 'pause' button on the handle that allow you to shut the water spray off quickly. This way, you can turn it on, position it in your mouth and then start the water spray.

It is not a clean process. It is almost impossible to use this without splashing water at some point.

The bottom line is that it does what it promises and my son has been using it. We'll see how good his teeth are when the braces come off in two years...",Good Waterpik with lots of Nozzle Choices,1320537600,,,all_beauty

3.0,True,"11 6, 2011",A1EVV74UQYVKRY,B000FOI48G,,K. Groh,"My 12 year old just got braces for the first time and the procedure to floss between his teeth was never going to happen. So the orthodontist recommended getting a Waterpik instead.

After looking at all the models, we choose this one. It holds a lot of water. It has storage in the lid for all the attachments, and it seemed easy to use.

I looked at the ones that were battery powered but I didn't think they would hold enough water and I couldn't see him refilling it to finish. This model has a big range of pressure that changes quickly with the turn of a dial. it does have to be plugged in and the handle is connected by a water tube. This does limit the distance from the unit to the mouth but it is more than enough if you are standing at a vanity.

There is a huge variety of tips but I don't think we will be using more than two or three. I actually wish that there were two or three of the basic tips for multiple family members instead of some of the other fancy tips.

The tips pop on and off easily and there is a 'pause' button on the handle that allow you to shut the water spray off quickly. This way, you can turn it on, position it in your mouth and then start the water spray.

It is not a clean process. It is almost impossible to use this without splashing water at some point.

The bottom line is that it does what it promises and my son has been using it. We'll see how good his teeth are when the braces come off in two years...",Good Waterpik with lots of Nozzle Choices,1320537600,,,all_beauty

After looking at all the models, we choose this one. It holds a lot of water. It has storage in the lid for all the attachments, and it seemed easy to use.

I looked at the ones that were battery powered but I didn't think they would hold enough water and I couldn't see him refilling it to finish. This model has a big range of pressure that changes quickly with the turn of a dial. it does have to be plugged in and the handle is connected by a water tube. This does limit the distance from the unit to the mouth but it is more than enough if you are standing at a vanity.

There is a huge variety of tips but I don't think we will be using more than two or three. I actually wish that there were two or three of the basic tips for multiple family members instead of some of the other fancy tips.

The tips pop on and off easily and there is a 'pause' button on the handle that allow you to shut the water spray off quickly. This way, you can turn it on, position it in your mouth and then start the water spray.

It is not a clean process. It is almost impossible to use this without splashing water at some point.

The bottom line is that it does what it promises and my son has been using it. We'll see how good his teeth are when the braces come off in two years...",Good Waterpik with lots of Nozzle Choices,1320537600,,,all_beauty

It saves sooo much time and effort. Honestly, if I use this and then use regular floss string afterward, I never have anything come out on the string. I love this Waterpik! My teeth feel so clean after using it.

It is easy to use. You just fill the basin with water, pick your setting with the dial, and turn it on. It is a little messy - water run off - but it is worth it! I use it on the highest setting with no discomfort or pain at all. The different heads are all very useful and store right in the lid of the basin. It flips open and there is a compartmnt to keep them all. The coiled cord stays neatly in place in the holster when not in use.

I use a basin full of water, then refill with half water/half mouthwash and my mouth and teeth feel so clean and so smooth. It feels like I just left the dentist. It is also easy to clean from behind the teeth as well.

This is definitely one of the best investments I have made. I definitely recommend this wether you have braces or not. My kids even like using it. I bought extra heads for it so they each have their own and can just pop it on when they use the Waterpik.",A must have for braces!,1302220800,,,all_beauty

(I couldn't find any explanation online as to whether or not the tub version was different than the tube version, but figured I just buy this big tub since it was more cost-effective.)

Since it took a few days for this to arrive from Amazon, I was using a moisturizer on the burned areas, which wasn't really doing much.  As soon as I started using the Aquaphor, I noticed a big difference in how my skin was healing.

This tub is huge, especially since you only need a tiny bit of this.  I plan on divvying it up into smaller containers so I can keep them around the house.

It seems to have a ton of uses; I've been applying it not only on those patches on my hand, but also on dry areas on my face (a result of using Carac cream to remove pre-cancerous patches also), on my lips, on my heels at night, and also on my cuticles.

- Adjustable neck strap (works on me and my 7 year-old son)
- Good size at 36"" x 54""
- Repels water
- Appears to be well made

~CONS~
I would prefer a snap closure versus the velcro which tends to hold hair - a minor gripe though.

I grew up in the mid-west, where for most people considering we are surrounded by corn fields and our communities are filled with farmers, comfort is more important than fashion. You are more likely to see farm and home stores than fashion stores. Anyway, this was only $5 so I took a chance on ordering it along with several other magazines (which I have a surplus of and am currently behind on reading lol) and this is one of the only ones that even though it is only $5, I had to cancel even if they didn't refund me. I just did not want this coming to my house every month. It is a thick magazine which is good and bad, but one issue was like an encyclopedia. When I started flipping through the pages, MOST of it was ads for products and designers. Just women posing in silly clothes and makeup. The articles, to me, were boring, bland, and not relevant to my life or interests. I read one article where a woman struggled with her appearance because she was Jewish and had a big nose and whatever and it made me kinda sad that she couldn't accept herself for such a long time. Everyone is beautiful in different ways and magazines like ELLE present a culture of one kind of beauty which really isn't beautiful. It's fake and kind of scary. So I just did not want this magazine in my house. I am sticking with more down to earth magazines. I enjoy a range of health magazines, home and family magazines, and girly magazines that aren't quite so fashion centered. Again, this is my opinion so please don't criticize me. I understand location has a lot to do with how you view fashion and body image but I am perfectly happy with me!

Update: I'm glad some people are finding my review helpful! I also forgot to mention that my mom (a woman in her 50's) exchanges magazines with me and this magazine has very small print which made the magazine hard for her to read. And I flipped through the last issue I received and most of the articles (at the end of the magazine since the first half of it is full of ads) were about feminism. I am not a feminist and that's as far as I'll go on that subject. You can formulate your own opinion of the articles. Just pointing it out to potential subscribers since I had no idea what to expect from this magazine. Another article in this magazine was defending photo shop and feeding false body images to women as artwork like it is no big deal! I was shocked because it contributes to eating disorders and low self esteem in many women, especially young women. A better name for this magazine would be SUPERFICIAL.",FULL OF ADS,1346889600,10,,magazine_subscriptions

Do not trust the content from here forward.

E-mail and cancel your subscriptions and send a message to this tyrant!  We want science and fact - not fiction and skewed articles serving right wing, mega corporate interests!!!

For a little while I was confused with the article selections.  It seemed they were picking some pieces that weren't really about geography, sociology, or history.  More like current events.  But the last year or two they have been on track with solid stories and spectacular photography.

I was more impressed with Smithsonian for awhile, but their new format is laughable (you can read my updated 3 star review at the Amazon listing:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smithsonian-1-year-automatic-renewal/dp/B0032KHQU2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smithsonian (1-year automatic renewal)</a>.  National Geographic has taken its place as top world history/sociology magazine again.

The stories may be less fleshed out than some other magazines.  These guys are definitely about the pictures.  But the pictures usually serve a purpose. They aren't just glossy and pretty.  Looking in a recent issue about global warming and population increase in Bangladesh, the pictures illustrate the point of the story: the struggles of many impoverished citizens in a country in the grip of climate change.

The stories have gotten less 'preachy' and don't tend to berate folks for not doing everything they can to help those in need.  Instead the stories tend to show both outlooks on a divided issue without painting one in a bad light.  Of course, the reader can usually infer from the nature of the story the outlook that Nat Geo favors.  It is a highly liberal magazine focused on conservation, but that is what they have been about for years, so it shouldn't surprise anyone.

I highly recommend this magazine for those folks looking for great stories on a variety of topics pertaining to nature, history, and people.",UPDATE: Purchased by science loathing media mogul Rupert Murdoch - cancel your subs immediately!,1346457600,9,,magazine_subscriptions

Unfortunately SA has gone and started to editorialize the information it reports. I'm amazed at the community of ""scientists""  who swear up and down the sky is falling,or at least that it has a hole in and we're all going to die because of it. Do these people take into consideration the absolute immensity of the earth and atmosphere? They can tell that us, unequivocally, that we are damaging the atmosphere and that apparently they know the correct climate conditions for earth in 2014. What a load of dreck! The earth is so massive that man amounts to a pimple on it. The atmosphere is so immense that earth is a speck of dust, they can't possibly know what the correct ratio of gasses and vapor is supposed to be, yet we are bombarded with junk science that says we are killing the planet and the atmosphere because we release gas and vapor. How about proof of concept? Hewal and stream, river or ocean. They can't but they want us to believe that they can heal the earth and atmosphere? If we can't find a pinging airliner in the Indian Ocean, how can we believe that these ""Chicken Little"" scientists and their gloom and doom forecasts? We can't control or influence the weather or the atmosphere around the globe, If everybody in China jumped up and down at the same time, could they influence the orbit of the earth? No! because it's so huge. it can't be done. Yet we hear daily that we have to sequester carbon and stop using petroleum and switch to solar, wind or unicorn power. Guess what happens to sequestered carbon in trees when the tree dies or is cut down. It gets released. Al Gore set  the alternative energy industry free with his forecast or ""Global Warming"".  We've spent billions of alternative energy (Solara) and objective people have figured out that we can't meet demands by converting to ""sustainable"" energy sources. We have been sold a bill of goods, pay no attention to the man or woman behind the curtain, The political theater of ""greenies"" are going to save the world using regulations and unfunded mandates. SA has drunk the Kool-Aid and are now mixing up and distributing batch after batch each month. Who believes that man can ""fix"" the weather or environment? Who believes that somebody can correctly predict the correct climate and weather conditions for earth in 2014?

I used to be an avid Cosmo reader in my 20's. Life got busy in my 30's, but, I have recently decided to re-subscribe. I am sad to report that the magazine has slipped considerably in general quality of information provided, as well as the manner in which it is done. I was looking forward to hot-off-the-press fashion news; I wanted to learn about the best beauty products on the market; I wanted to read stories relevant to my life with real life heroines who inspire other real life women. Well, it was not to be. What I got was a little bit of fashion and beauty with the rest being a poorly written sex manual. Oh, ""how to manipulate your man"" was also high on the magazine's agenda... Here are some titles from the August issue:

""She Had Her First One Night Stand at 34"" (she's for it and it's in the Need to Know section of the magazine...)
""Secrets His Sex Style Reveals""
""Guys Rate 125 Sex Moves""
""Get Hit On All The Time""
""Orgasm Whisperer""
""First Time Sex Bloopers""
""Cosmo's Naughty Sex Dare Game""

I could go on, but I am feeling noxious again...It's rather disturbing that teenagers and young women are reading this and may be getting the idea that this is all their life is supposed to be about: having sex, all the time, with strangers, as well as manipulating men... Sad...

If you are looking for magazines with fashion/beauty focus, I recommend: In Style, Style Watch, and Lucky.

Gone are all the great articles about meditation, healthy mind-body, different yoga-related philosophies, etc.

The staff worked well together and they put out a consistently good magazine. Then it went through some rough years where it got kind of tame and boring. Now, it's an ill fitting mix of new and old writers trying to be fresh and hip while being spoon fed by the car manufactures. The magazine lacks consistency, focus and any sort of clear vision as to what they're about.

C&D mostly seems to print what the biggest manufactures want them to. There have been several articles lately, such as on the new Nissan GT-R and Corvette ZR1, that literally mirror articles in other magazines even featuring some of the same quotes from the same car execs.

I used to be an avid Cosmo reader in my 20's. Life got busy in my 30's, but, I have recently decided to re-subscribe. I am sad to report that the magazine has slipped considerably in general quality of information provided, as well as the manner in which it is done. I was looking forward to hot-off-the-press fashion news; I wanted to learn about the best beauty products on the market; I wanted to read stories relevant to my life with real life heroines who inspire other real life women. Well, it was not to be. What I got was a little bit of fashion and beauty with the rest being a poorly written sex manual. Oh, ""how to manipulate your man"" was also high on the magazine's agenda... Here are some titles from the August issue:

""She Had Her First One Night Stand at 34"" (she's for it and it's in the Need to Know section of the magazine...)
""Secrets His Sex Style Reveals""
""Guys Rate 125 Sex Moves""
""Get Hit On All The Time""
""Orgasm Whisperer""
""First Time Sex Bloopers""
""Cosmo's Naughty Sex Dare Game""

I could go on, but I am feeling noxious again...It's rather disturbing that teenagers and young women are reading this and may be getting the idea that this is all their life is supposed to be about: having sex, all the time, with strangers, as well as manipulating men... Sad...

If you are looking for magazines with fashion/beauty focus, I recommend: In Style, Style Watch, and Lucky.

Unfortunately SA has gone and started to editorialize the information it reports. I'm amazed at the community of ""scientists""  who swear up and down the sky is falling,or at least that it has a hole in and we're all going to die because of it. Do these people take into consideration the absolute immensity of the earth and atmosphere? They can tell that us, unequivocally, that we are damaging the atmosphere and that apparently they know the correct climate conditions for earth in 2014. What a load of dreck! The earth is so massive that man amounts to a pimple on it. The atmosphere is so immense that earth is a speck of dust, they can't possibly know what the correct ratio of gasses and vapor is supposed to be, yet we are bombarded with junk science that says we are killing the planet and the atmosphere because we release gas and vapor. How about proof of concept? Hewal and stream, river or ocean. They can't but they want us to believe that they can heal the earth and atmosphere? If we can't find a pinging airliner in the Indian Ocean, how can we believe that these ""Chicken Little"" scientists and their gloom and doom forecasts? We can't control or influence the weather or the atmosphere around the globe, If everybody in China jumped up and down at the same time, could they influence the orbit of the earth? No! because it's so huge. it can't be done. Yet we hear daily that we have to sequester carbon and stop using petroleum and switch to solar, wind or unicorn power. Guess what happens to sequestered carbon in trees when the tree dies or is cut down. It gets released. Al Gore set  the alternative energy industry free with his forecast or ""Global Warming"".  We've spent billions of alternative energy (Solara) and objective people have figured out that we can't meet demands by converting to ""sustainable"" energy sources. We have been sold a bill of goods, pay no attention to the man or woman behind the curtain, The political theater of ""greenies"" are going to save the world using regulations and unfunded mandates. SA has drunk the Kool-Aid and are now mixing up and distributing batch after batch each month. Who believes that man can ""fix"" the weather or environment? Who believes that somebody can correctly predict the correct climate and weather conditions for earth in 2014?

I grew up in the mid-west, where for most people considering we are surrounded by corn fields and our communities are filled with farmers, comfort is more important than fashion. You are more likely to see farm and home stores than fashion stores. Anyway, this was only $5 so I took a chance on ordering it along with several other magazines (which I have a surplus of and am currently behind on reading lol) and this is one of the only ones that even though it is only $5, I had to cancel even if they didn't refund me. I just did not want this coming to my house every month. It is a thick magazine which is good and bad, but one issue was like an encyclopedia. When I started flipping through the pages, MOST of it was ads for products and designers. Just women posing in silly clothes and makeup. The articles, to me, were boring, bland, and not relevant to my life or interests. I read one article where a woman struggled with her appearance because she was Jewish and had a big nose and whatever and it made me kinda sad that she couldn't accept herself for such a long time. Everyone is beautiful in different ways and magazines like ELLE present a culture of one kind of beauty which really isn't beautiful. It's fake and kind of scary. So I just did not want this magazine in my house. I am sticking with more down to earth magazines. I enjoy a range of health magazines, home and family magazines, and girly magazines that aren't quite so fashion centered. Again, this is my opinion so please don't criticize me. I understand location has a lot to do with how you view fashion and body image but I am perfectly happy with me!

Update: I'm glad some people are finding my review helpful! I also forgot to mention that my mom (a woman in her 50's) exchanges magazines with me and this magazine has very small print which made the magazine hard for her to read. And I flipped through the last issue I received and most of the articles (at the end of the magazine since the first half of it is full of ads) were about feminism. I am not a feminist and that's as far as I'll go on that subject. You can formulate your own opinion of the articles. Just pointing it out to potential subscribers since I had no idea what to expect from this magazine. Another article in this magazine was defending photo shop and feeding false body images to women as artwork like it is no big deal! I was shocked because it contributes to eating disorders and low self esteem in many women, especially young women.

Unfortunately SA has gone and started to editorialize the information it reports. I'm amazed at the community of ""scientists""  who swear up and down the sky is falling,or at least that it has a hole in and we're all going to die because of it. Do these people take into consideration the absolute immensity of the earth and atmosphere? They can tell that us, unequivocally, that we are damaging the atmosphere and that apparently they know the correct climate conditions for earth in 2014. What a load of dreck! The earth is so massive that man amounts to a pimple on it. The atmosphere is so immense that earth is a speck of dust, they can't possibly know what the correct ratio of gasses and vapor is supposed to be, yet we are bombarded with junk science that says we are killing the planet and the atmosphere because we release gas and vapor. How about proof of concept? Hewal and stream, river or ocean. They can't but they want us to believe that they can heal the earth and atmosphere? If we can't find a pinging airliner in the Indian Ocean, how can we believe that these ""Chicken Little"" scientists and their gloom and doom forecasts?

The staff worked well together and they put out a consistently good magazine. Then it went through some rough years where it got kind of tame and boring. Now, it's an ill fitting mix of new and old writers trying to be fresh and hip while being spoon fed by the car manufactures. The magazine lacks consistency, focus and any sort of clear vision as to what they're about.

C&D mostly seems to print what the biggest manufactures want them to. There have been several articles lately, such as on the new Nissan GT-R and Corvette ZR1, that literally mirror articles in other magazines even featuring some of the same quotes from the same car execs.

E-mail and cancel your subscriptions and send a message to this tyrant!  We want science and fact - not fiction and skewed articles serving right wing, mega corporate interests!!!

For a little while I was confused with the article selections.  It seemed they were picking some pieces that weren't really about geography, sociology, or history.  More like current events.  But the last year or two they have been on track with solid stories and spectacular photography.

I was more impressed with Smithsonian for awhile, but their new format is laughable (you can read my updated 3 star review at the Amazon listing:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smithsonian-1-year-automatic-renewal/dp/B0032KHQU2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smithsonian (1-year automatic renewal)</a>.  National Geographic has taken its place as top world history/sociology magazine again.

The stories may be less fleshed out than some other magazines.  These guys are definitely about the pictures.  But the pictures usually serve a purpose. They aren't just glossy and pretty.  Looking in a recent issue about global warming and population increase in Bangladesh, the pictures illustrate the point of the story: the struggles of many impoverished citizens in a country in the grip of climate change.

The stories have gotten less 'preachy' and don't tend to berate folks for not doing everything they can to help those in need.  Instead the stories tend to show both outlooks on a divided issue without painting one in a bad light.  Of course, the reader can usually infer from the nature of the story the outlook that Nat Geo favors.  It is a highly liberal magazine focused on conservation, but that is what they have been about for years, so it shouldn't surprise anyone.

I highly recommend this magazine for those folks looking for great stories on a variety of topics pertaining to nature, history, and people.",UPDATE: Purchased by science loathing media mogul Rupert Murdoch - cancel your subs immediately!,1346457600,9,,magazine_subscriptions

I used to be an avid Cosmo reader in my 20's. Life got busy in my 30's, but, I have recently decided to re-subscribe. I am sad to report that the magazine has slipped considerably in general quality of information provided, as well as the manner in which it is done. I was looking forward to hot-off-the-press fashion news; I wanted to learn about the best beauty products on the market; I wanted to read stories relevant to my life with real life heroines who inspire other real life women. Well, it was not to be. What I got was a little bit of fashion and beauty with the rest being a poorly written sex manual. Oh, ""how to manipulate your man"" was also high on the magazine's agenda... Here are some titles from the August issue:

""She Had Her First One Night Stand at 34"" (she's for it and it's in the Need to Know section of the magazine...)
""Secrets His Sex Style Reveals""
""Guys Rate 125 Sex Moves""
""Get Hit On All The Time""
""Orgasm Whisperer""
""First Time Sex Bloopers""
""Cosmo's Naughty Sex Dare Game""

I could go on, but I am feeling noxious again...It's rather disturbing that teenagers and young women are reading this and may be getting the idea that this is all their life is supposed to be about: having sex, all the time, with strangers, as well as manipulating men... Sad...

If you are looking for magazines with fashion/beauty focus, I recommend: In Style, Style Watch, and Lucky.

I grew up in the mid-west, where for most people considering we are surrounded by corn fields and our communities are filled with farmers, comfort is more important than fashion. You are more likely to see farm and home stores than fashion stores. Anyway, this was only $5 so I took a chance on ordering it along with several other magazines (which I have a surplus of and am currently behind on reading lol) and this is one of the only ones that even though it is only $5, I had to cancel even if they didn't refund me. I just did not want this coming to my house every month. It is a thick magazine which is good and bad, but one issue was like an encyclopedia. When I started flipping through the pages, MOST of it was ads for products and designers. Just women posing in silly clothes and makeup. The articles, to me, were boring, bland, and not relevant to my life or interests. I read one article where a woman struggled with her appearance because she was Jewish and had a big nose and whatever and it made me kinda sad that she couldn't accept herself for such a long time. Everyone is beautiful in different ways and magazines like ELLE present a culture of one kind of beauty which really isn't beautiful. It's fake and kind of scary. So I just did not want this magazine in my house. I am sticking with more down to earth magazines.

I used to be an avid Cosmo reader in my 20's. Life got busy in my 30's, but, I have recently decided to re-subscribe. I am sad to report that the magazine has slipped considerably in general quality of information provided, as well as the manner in which it is done. I was looking forward to hot-off-the-press fashion news; I wanted to learn about the best beauty products on the market; I wanted to read stories relevant to my life with real life heroines who inspire other real life women. Well, it was not to be. What I got was a little bit of fashion and beauty with the rest being a poorly written sex manual. Oh, ""how to manipulate your man"" was also high on the magazine's agenda... Here are some titles from the August issue:

""She Had Her First One Night Stand at 34"" (she's for it and it's in the Need to Know section of the magazine...)
""Secrets His Sex Style Reveals""
""Guys Rate 125 Sex Moves""
""Get Hit On All The Time""
""Orgasm Whisperer""
""First Time Sex Bloopers""
""Cosmo's Naughty Sex Dare Game""

I could go on, but I am feeling noxious again...It's rather disturbing that teenagers and young women are reading this and may be getting the idea that this is all their life is supposed to be about: having sex, all the time, with strangers, as well as manipulating men... Sad...

If you are looking for magazines with fashion/beauty focus, I recommend: In Style, Style Watch, and Lucky.

Do not trust the content from here forward.  He is planning to turn the magazine and society into a for profit organization in order to hide science and progress under the guise of a 'scientific journal'.

E-mail and cancel your subscriptions and send a message to this tyrant!  We want science and fact - not fiction and skewed articles serving right wing, mega corporate interests!!!

For a little while I was confused with the article selections.  It seemed they were picking some pieces that weren't really about geography, sociology, or history.  More like current events.  But the last year or two they have been on track with solid stories and spectacular photography.

I was more impressed with Smithsonian for awhile, but their new format is laughable (you can read my updated 3 star review at the Amazon listing:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smithsonian-1-year-automatic-renewal/dp/B0032KHQU2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smithsonian (1-year automatic renewal)</a>.  National Geographic has taken its place as top world history/sociology magazine again.

The stories may be less fleshed out than some other magazines.  These guys are definitely about the pictures.  But the pictures usually serve a purpose. They aren't just glossy and pretty.  Looking in a recent issue about global warming and population increase in Bangladesh, the pictures illustrate the point of the story: the struggles of many impoverished citizens in a country in the grip of climate change.

The stories have gotten less 'preachy' and don't tend to berate folks for not doing everything they can to help those in need.  Instead the stories tend to show both outlooks on a divided issue without painting one in a bad light.  Of course, the reader can usually infer from the nature of the story the outlook that Nat Geo favors.  It is a highly liberal magazine focused on conservation, but that is what they have been about for years, so it shouldn't surprise anyone.

I highly recommend this magazine for those folks looking for great stories on a variety of topics pertaining to nature, history, and people.",UPDATE: Purchased by science loathing media mogul Rupert Murdoch - cancel your subs immediately!,1346457600,9,,magazine_subscriptions

Ok, I do cook a lot, but my hubby is gluten free so a lot of the recipes are unusable, or need modification.

Like all other ""home"" mags it's very consumer-driven. Buy this new cleaner/foundation/moisturizer. Buy these new rugs/lamps/sofas. Buy these backpacks/storage cubes/clothes that are trending now for your kids. Buy, buy, buy. I find this very off-putting. Even  the ""budget"" room remodels (furniture replacement) usually have ridiculously priced rugs, lamps, or chairs that I can't ever imagine buying.

There are articles on handling family, financial, and social issues, party planning, etc as you would expect. It is very current, with discussions of sex (though not as frank as Redbook is), social media, and other issues.

Bottom line, if you are a modern mom with some disposable income trying to ""do it all and look fabulous"" this is probably right for you. For me, no kids, not so youth-driven, seldom entertain, it's not that interesting.

One thing this mag has over others in the Good Housekeeping Seal. They have the courage to stand behind items they feel truly work well and add to the quality of life for users.","Good for families, moms on the PTA, and those who entertain or cook a lot #2",1379116800,,,magazine_subscriptions

Ok, I do cook a lot, but my hubby is gluten free so a lot of the recipes are unusable, or need modification.

Like all other ""home"" mags it's very consumer-driven. Buy this new cleaner/foundation/moisturizer. Buy these new rugs/lamps/sofas. Buy these backpacks/storage cubes/clothes that are trending now for your kids. Buy, buy, buy. I find this very off-putting. Even  the ""budget"" room remodels (furniture replacement) usually have ridiculously priced rugs, lamps, or chairs that I can't ever imagine buying.

There are articles on handling family, financial, and social issues, party planning, etc as you would expect. It is very current, with discussions of sex (though not as frank as Redbook is), social media, and other issues.

Bottom line, if you are a modern mom with some disposable income trying to ""do it all and look fabulous"" this is probably right for you. For me, no kids, not so youth-driven, seldom entertain, it's not that interesting.

This is a great improvement over Elizabeth Mayhew, who took over as editor for Jane Chesnutt and served in that role from 2010 to 2012.

Over all, this article is a quick-read - you can get through the entire magazine in one sitting in about half an hour. I think the target demographic for this magazine might be women ages 35 to 65 years old. For example, there is usually at least one article related to coping with senior parents.

I grew up on a dairy, milked through college to pay for tuition and food, and managed a dairy for several years. Now DH and I own 38 forested acres, with a horse, goats, and garden, and I am interested in other farming ventures. So I decided to give this a try.

Yes, it treats topics in a very surface way, and is probably best suited for the armchair farmer, rather than the one with callouses. The article on dairy udders was interesting, but it was a salad, not a steak. No meat. Had I written it, even with years away from milking, it would have filled a lot more pages. Kudos, BTW, on finding a Holstein with a shapely udder. Those were few and far between in my milking years.

It's entertaining but just not enough substance. I have been considering growing mushrooms, so I was excited to see the Fungi Fruit article. Well, 2.5 pages later, all I really learned is that the pricey portabellas are just regular button mushrooms from a second or third flush. Lots of pretty pictures, but I was looking for information. Sadly lacking.

Bottom line, if you like to read brief interesting articles and look at pretty pictures because you are dreaming a happy fantasy of farm life, you'll like this magazine. If you are already out before dawn in the sleet feeding, planting, or milking, you are waaay past this.","Fun for fantasy farmers, interesting articles and pretty pics.

I just received my first (September-2015) issue (August 7, 2015) which took a month and a half.  I found the magazine to have many interesting articles and departments.  I especially enjoyed reading Style & Design 2015, Secrets of a secret agent by Josh Eells and The lethal thrills of BASE jumping by Phil Klay.

Other departments include: Record book, four-day week-end, adventure, travel, dispatch, food, spirits, fashion and essay.  I also enjoyed the health & fitness section explaining the facts about eating red meat. The last word column was also interesting with an interview with Merle Haggard. This magazine is aimed obviously at the young professional man who likes cars, tech tools and adventure hobbies.

If you are into fashion, cars, high tech tools and adventure you should check out this mens magazine.

The past months articles on saving money were well thought out and were easy things to try.  The idea of putting a filled bottle water in the back of your toilet to decrease how much water needed per flush was a great idea!  The one reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the constant need to have celebrities on the front cover while the articles about them aren't direct interviews - just some statements made to other people here and there.

Don't expect detailed plans for how to implement any of the ideas shown. However, I usually get at least a couple good ideas of out each issue. I prefer this magazine to Martha Stewart Living, which is more food-focused. Don't get me wrong - there are still plenty of food recipes in each issue of Country Living. However, it's a nice balance between articles on food, decor, DIY/crafts, flowers, and entertaining.

UPDATE: I used to look forward to receiving my issues in the mail. However, the magazine seems to be going in a new direction. One part of that is focusing more on older items, such as expensive vintage items I could never afford to buy. Another part is focusing on rustic items with patina, but to me, the items just look rusty and neglected. Those gruff items are pricey too. I don't want to fill my home with a bunch of nonsense items. That includes the nature-inspired items such as taxidermy. I'm not sure what is going on with this magazine to be honest.

There are some interesting articles, many intended for beginners.  Since the vast majority of yoga students are beginners, they are definitely hitting the target market.  But being a very advanced practitioner, I wasn't expecting too much from this magazine.  I was slightly surprised though from several of the peripheral articles.  That is, the articles not about the actual physical activity of yoga, but about the mind and lifestyle associated with.  Things like adding Feng Shui to your abode or tips for vacationing or improving wellness.

That is why I actually give it some good stars.  The one less star than perfect is because this magazine has TONS of ads.  Lots.  And many are for companies and products that many yoga students could care less about... Though some are of interest.  I don't mind some Lululemon and Gaiam ads, but flip through one issue and you see that nearly 2/3 of the magazine is ad space...  But I guess that's where the money is.  Not in the $5 to $15 per year subscriptions.

Also of note:  9 issues.  Not 12 for a year.  Just fyi.

If you know what you're getting with this periodical, then it's a good thing to have.  Just don't be shocked that the poses mentioned are pretty basic, or some of the fundamentals are covered over and over again.  It's meant for the beginner.  I have a couple of books that have more advanced information and those are what I use for improving my alignment in poses:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Athlete-s-Guide-to-Yoga-An-Integrated-Approach-to-Strength-Flexibility-and-Focus/dp/193403004X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Athlete's Guide to Yoga: An Integrated Approach to Strength, Flexibility, and Focus</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Optimal-Health-for-a-Vibrant-Life-A-30-Day-Program-to-Detoxify-and-Replenish-Body-and-Mind/dp/1451548435/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Optimal Health for a Vibrant Life: A 30-Day Program to Detoxify and Replenish Body and Mind</a>.

The result: one page you are reading about ten best eyelash curlers, next page you are pondering the tragic fate of a female South American assassin. A radiculous combination...

Not so with In-Style. The magazine does not make pretentions about its purpose: to educate women on what to wear NOW, how to wear it and where to buy it. There is ample advice on best beauty and hair products. The articles are always fashion/entertainment industry related, nothing too heavy duty (for that I go on CNN.com and BBC.co.uk), and convey lots of useful information. To give you an example: with winter approaching, I know I must invest in a new coat and some other warmer garb. I want to make every penny count. In the September issue I was glad to discover the article: What to Know Before You Shop. I did learn some new tips and tricks! The multitude of pictures is also inspiring: I realized with only a couple of new accessories and a new way of combining items I already own, I could create at least three brand new and fashion forward outfits! Yey for me! ;o) I am also happy to report that the magazine promotes a wide range of price points: yes, there are some ""dream"" items, like the [...]+ necklace, but they are balanced by items below the [...] mark and everything in-between.

As far as the magazine goes, from my past issues I find it the homes they feature have a great balance between modern, eclectic and chic design - definitely leans toward lux! Looking forward to having next month's issue in the mailbox.

02/16/21 Update : The March 2012 edition has just arrived, which makes for a 12 week lag time in receiving the first issue. - DG","elegant, spohisticated, but slow delivery!",1327622400,2,,magazine_subscriptions

They refer to the Feb 2012 issue as ""the White Issue"" with decorating ideas that involve white/neutrals - lots of examples of antiques and replicas throughout the magazine.

just a a quick sample of what's inside -

* Collecting this month focuses on match safes with photos of gorgeous antique versions.
* the center layout featuring a beautiful home done in pared back white and warm wood.
* more on whites in formal and eclectic settings.
* an article on the Coombs maple farm in Vermont with recipes for Sour Cream Pancakes with Maple-Pecan Butter and Tomato-Cheddar Strata.

I like that this is one magazine I subscribe to that I see prices quoted for little splurges that are affordable like simple/functional yet gorgeous custom stamped leather luggage tags for $13.95. This is already the second place in the issue in just the first few pages that highlights women artisans and made in the USA hand crafted goods. This magazine tries to keep things accessible to its readers, quoting sources we can use not just designer industry insiders.

Yes, there are a ton of ads (like pretty much any other magazine) but if the ads help keep my subscription cost to a measly $5 per year then the ads are fine with me!

I give the magazine itself 3.5 stars and the price with it 4 stars.  There are many good ideas in this magazine and one of the only magazines besides my favorite (All You) that offers normal clothes and normal stores.  The past months articles on saving money were well thought out and were easy things to try.  The idea of putting a filled bottle water in the back of your toilet to decrease how much water needed per flush was a great idea!  The one reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the constant need to have celebrities on the front cover while the articles about them aren't direct interviews - just some statements made to other people here and there.

After receiving my first issue I was very pleased that I ordered this title; having live 30 minutes from Manhattan most of my life and now residing in the high desert plains, this is defintely my Zsa-Zsa/Green Acres fix for the month!

I like how they always apply the fashion trends for women of any age - 20's to 70's.

This issue had generous articles about Patti Hansen and Madonna - whether you care for them or not I think they are real legends as opposed to the various Kardashians that always seem to be on every other cover these days. They do give a nod to up-and-comers by including features like the one with model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.

I don't mind the many ads since they keep the publishing costs low.

A little talk of everything current - art, movies, books and of course the fashion....

Edelman,"The New Yorker was started by Harold Ross as a humor magazine, and grew into one of the world's most celebrated literary magazines. It never really made money or had a huge circulation, but survived thanks to the generosity of a number of private owners and publishers. I began reading the New Yorker thanks to my mother, who subscribed for nearly four decades. Through it I discovered Berton Rouche's fascinating ""Medical Detective"" stories, Calvin Trillin's hilarious stories about food and travel, the brilliant writing of John McPhee, and scores of other contemporary reporters and short story writers.
Then, in the 1980s, Trisha Brown then managed to completely trash the magazine in only a few short years. Circulation took off- for a time, at least- but the reputation of the New Yorker was sacrificed as it was turned into a gossip magazine. The low point, for me, at least, was a fawning article on poor Erich Honnekar's trial in Germany where he was being charged for ordering the shootings of those East Germans who tried to flee to the west. (Brown's husband, it turned out, had been retained by Honnekar's defense team to do PR work).
Old time subscribers defected by the thousands, and the new subscribers, being a fickle lot, let their subscriptions lapse as well once The New Yorker was no longer a hip fashion accessory to be seen on your coffeetable alongside the latest issue of Interview.
In recent years the magazine has regained some- but not all- or its former glory. The political analysis is still of the fawning variety (neither the Clintons nor the Kennedys can do any wrong) and the fiction has become even more parochial, but a lot of the good reporting has returned. I don't subscribe, but I do peruse issues on the newstand regularly in case I might come across a particularly intersting story. I suggest you might do the same.",Variable,1056931200,27,,magazine_subscriptions

I feel that many reviewers have unrealistic expectations for this magazine. At the time I am writing this review, Amazon is charging $20 for a yearly subscription to Time, which amounts to less than forty cents per issue. At this low price, I do not expect high quality journalism but a magazine that does a basic job at covering general news.

For those seeking quality journalism, I recommend the economist, and the new yorker. By charging subscribers more, the economist has been able to afford to maintain and enhance the quality of its magazine. Keep in mind that a subscription to the economist is six times more than a subscription to Time magazine. At the time, I am writing this the magazine industry is experience record drops in advertising revenue, Time just announced layoffs. In light of all this, this magazine is doing its best to maintains its quality.

- Cheap
- Provides a general overview
- Has no annoying magazine inserts (my pet peeve)

However, it's a nice balance between articles on food, decor, DIY/crafts, flowers, and entertaining.

UPDATE: I used to look forward to receiving my issues in the mail. However, the magazine seems to be going in a new direction. One part of that is focusing more on older items, such as expensive vintage items I could never afford to buy. Another part is focusing on rustic items with patina, but to me, the items just look rusty and neglected. Those gruff items are pricey too. I don't want to fill my home with a bunch of nonsense items. That includes the nature-inspired items such as taxidermy. I'm not sure what is going on with this magazine to be honest.

There seems to be a trend out there, and I can't be the only one that notices it, but over the last year or so, some of my favorite magazines have cut down on the amount of pages in each issue and it is noticeable. I know the economy is in a sh-t, but I did pay in advance for a cerain magazine. Suddenly, all these magazine shrink the issues without any notice what so over. And they expect to keep us when the price remains the same for less of the magazine. I don't know. For this reason, I didn't want to pay a lot to renew. I figured I'd renew for one more year to give it a chance, and see where the magazine is headed. Happily, the price at Amazon.com beat the renewal/new subscription prices offered by Backpacker magazine itself. Imagine that. Hopefully, Backpacker goes back to where it was, instead of where it seems to be going. If it doesn't, it'll be another magazine I will not renew.

Now, my subscripiton is coming to an end. I almost didn't renew, as with other magazines of late, the quality is going downhill and the magazine has lost about 20 pages. It is not what is used to be. There seems to be a trend out there, and I can't be the only one that notices it, but over the last year or so, some of my favorite magazines have cut down on the amount of pages in each issue and it is noticeable. I know the economy is in a sh-t, but I did pay in advance for a cerain magazine. Suddenly, all these magazine shrink the issues without any notice what so over. And they expect to keep us when the price remains the same for less of the magazine. I don't know. For this reason, I didn't want to pay a lot to renew. I figured I'd renew for one more year to give it a chance, and see where the magazine is headed. Happily, the price at Amazon.com beat the renewal/new subscription prices offered by Backpacker magazine itself. Imagine that. Hopefully, Backpacker goes back to where it was, instead of where it seems to be going. If it doesn't, it'll be another magazine I will not renew. You'd think the publishers would want to keep the subscribers they do have, but they don't. I know because I have contacted editors of a few magazines: Smart Computing for one and the editor first asked me what I missed. When I told him, he couldn't care less. What a bad attitude!

I am not ""Joe Fix-It"" and seriously count myself lucky to still have all my appendages after some bad attempts at working on projects around the house (my wife actually hid some of my tools after the infamous ""Strap Wrench incident of '06""), but this magazine has a good selection of projects and ideas that occasionally fall into my skill range.

The magazine is nicely laid-out and is easy to follow the articles and projects. It does have a lot of adds, which is actually not such a bad thing since I like to see new products.

Very experienced handymen will not get a lot out of this, but it is usually helpful to me.

Don't expect detailed plans for how to implement any of the ideas shown. However, I usually get at least a couple good ideas of out each issue. I prefer this magazine to Martha Stewart Living, which is more food-focused. Don't get me wrong - there are still plenty of food recipes in each issue of Country Living. However, it's a nice balance between articles on food, decor, DIY/crafts, flowers, and entertaining.

UPDATE: I used to look forward to receiving my issues in the mail. However, the magazine seems to be going in a new direction. One part of that is focusing more on older items, such as expensive vintage items I could never afford to buy. Another part is focusing on rustic items with patina, but to me, the items just look rusty and neglected. Those gruff items are pricey too. I don't want to fill my home with a bunch of nonsense items. That includes the nature-inspired items such as taxidermy. I'm not sure what is going on with this magazine to be honest.

After receiving my first issue I was very pleased that I ordered this title; having live 30 minutes from Manhattan most of my life and now residing in the high desert plains, this is defintely my Zsa-Zsa/Green Acres fix for the month!

I like how they always apply the fashion trends for women of any age - 20's to 70's.

This issue had generous articles about Patti Hansen and Madonna - whether you care for them or not I think they are real legends as opposed to the various Kardashians that always seem to be on every other cover these days. They do give a nod to up-and-comers by including features like the one with model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.

I don't mind the many ads since they keep the publishing costs low.

A little talk of everything current - art, movies, books and of course the fashion....

The result: one page you are reading about ten best eyelash curlers, next page you are pondering the tragic fate of a female South American assassin. A radiculous combination...

Not so with In-Style. The magazine does not make pretentions about its purpose: to educate women on what to wear NOW, how to wear it and where to buy it. There is ample advice on best beauty and hair products. The articles are always fashion/entertainment industry related, nothing too heavy duty (for that I go on CNN.com and BBC.co.uk), and convey lots of useful information. To give you an example: with winter approaching, I know I must invest in a new coat and some other warmer garb. I want to make every penny count. In the September issue I was glad to discover the article: What to Know Before You Shop. I did learn some new tips and tricks! The multitude of pictures is also inspiring: I realized with only a couple of new accessories and a new way of combining items I already own, I could create at least three brand new and fashion forward outfits! Yey for me! ;o) I am also happy to report that the magazine promotes a wide range of price points: yes, there are some ""dream"" items, like the [...]+ necklace, but they are balanced by items below the [...] mark and everything in-between.

It is not quite as technical and in depth as I would like, but how many people would subscribe if it were readable only to physics PhDs?  I do rather enjoy the 'scratching the surface' approach to the articles. I find that there is enough information to give a good overview and decent scientific understanding of the topic yet it is not so complex that I feel as if I am 'working'.

There are also some interesting nerdy fun articles such as the worst ideas from the DOD (flying humvees, mutant mosquitos, etc...) to keep a smile of your face.  However, the vast majority of the articles are serious and well written.

The idea of putting a filled bottle water in the back of your toilet to decrease how much water needed per flush was a great idea!  The one reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the constant need to have celebrities on the front cover while the articles about them aren't direct interviews - just some statements made to other people here and there.

I am not ""Joe Fix-It"" and seriously count myself lucky to still have all my appendages after some bad attempts at working on projects around the house (my wife actually hid some of my tools after the infamous ""Strap Wrench incident of '06""), but this magazine has a good selection of projects and ideas that occasionally fall into my skill range.

The magazine is nicely laid-out and is easy to follow the articles and projects. It does have a lot of adds, which is actually not such a bad thing since I like to see new products.

Very experienced handymen will not get a lot out of this, but it is usually helpful to me.

I just received my first (September-2015) issue (August 7, 2015) which took a month and a half.  I found the magazine to have many interesting articles and departments.  I especially enjoyed reading Style & Design 2015, Secrets of a secret agent by Josh Eells and The lethal thrills of BASE jumping by Phil Klay.

Other departments include: Record book, four-day week-end, adventure, travel, dispatch, food, spirits, fashion and essay.  I also enjoyed the health & fitness section explaining the facts about eating red meat. The last word column was also interesting with an interview with Merle Haggard. This magazine is aimed obviously at the young professional man who likes cars, tech tools and adventure hobbies.

If you are into fashion, cars, high tech tools and adventure you should check out this mens magazine.

They refer to the Feb 2012 issue as ""the White Issue"" with decorating ideas that involve white/neutrals - lots of examples of antiques and replicas throughout the magazine.

just a a quick sample of what's inside -

* Collecting this month focuses on match safes with photos of gorgeous antique versions.
* the center layout featuring a beautiful home done in pared back white and warm wood.
* more on whites in formal and eclectic settings.
* an article on the Coombs maple farm in Vermont with recipes for Sour Cream Pancakes with Maple-Pecan Butter and Tomato-Cheddar Strata.

I like that this is one magazine I subscribe to that I see prices quoted for little splurges that are affordable like simple/functional yet gorgeous custom stamped leather luggage tags for $13.95. This is already the second place in the issue in just the first few pages that highlights women artisans and made in the USA hand crafted goods. This magazine tries to keep things accessible to its readers, quoting sources we can use not just designer industry insiders.

Yes, there are a ton of ads (like pretty much any other magazine) but if the ads help keep my subscription cost to a measly $5 per year then the ads are fine with me!

Pleased with this purchase and definitely recommended.",a little of what's inside the february 2012 issue,1326758400,10,,magazine_subscriptions

3.0,True,"09 25, 2012",A3OXHLG6DIBRW8,B00005N7Q1,{'Format:': ' Print Magazine'},C. Hill,"This ""Family Handyman"" magazine is a good choice for the home woodworking hobbyist and also for those that want to learn how to do basic home repairs. I am not ""Joe Fix-It"" and seriously count myself lucky to still have all my appendages after some bad attempts at working on projects around the house (my wife actually hid some of my tools after the infamous ""Strap Wrench incident of '06""), but this magazine has a good selection of projects and ideas that occasionally fall into my skill range.

The magazine is nicely laid-out and is easy to follow the articles and projects. It does have a lot of adds, which is actually not such a bad thing since I like to see new products.

Very experienced handymen will not get a lot out of this, but it is usually helpful to me.

Hill,"This ""Family Handyman"" magazine is a good choice for the home woodworking hobbyist and also for those that want to learn how to do basic home repairs. I am not ""Joe Fix-It"" and seriously count myself lucky to still have all my appendages after some bad attempts at working on projects around the house (my wife actually hid some of my tools after the infamous ""Strap Wrench incident of '06""), but this magazine has a good selection of projects and ideas that occasionally fall into my skill range.

The magazine is nicely laid-out and is easy to follow the articles and projects. It does have a lot of adds, which is actually not such a bad thing since I like to see new products.

Very experienced handymen will not get a lot out of this, but it is usually helpful to me.

A couple of highlights from this issue:

* Antique patterns and timeless fables inspire Idarica Gazzoni's fabrics and wallpaper
* Trend Alert - Paisley gets its groove back

I just received my first (September-2015) issue (August 7, 2015) which took a month and a half.  I found the magazine to have many interesting articles and departments.  I especially enjoyed reading Style & Design 2015, Secrets of a secret agent by Josh Eells and The lethal thrills of BASE jumping by Phil Klay.

Other departments include: Record book, four-day week-end, adventure, travel, dispatch, food, spirits, fashion and essay.  I also enjoyed the health & fitness section explaining the facts about eating red meat. The last word column was also interesting with an interview with Merle Haggard. This magazine is aimed obviously at the young professional man who likes cars, tech tools and adventure hobbies.

If you are into fashion, cars, high tech tools and adventure you should check out this mens magazine.

Elle Decor delivers. I anticipate its arrival each month. The magazine is great for training your eye as to what's interesting, stylish and beautiful in today's design world. If you are wanting to update any tired and boring rooms in your home, or rooms you're bored with, it's great for showing you what's new or being reinterpreted in a fresh way.  Then you can pick and choose what appeals to you.

Taste is about exposure and Elle Decor exposes you to what top designers are doing today so you can incorporate the elements you like in your own home. It features all kinds of rooms and styles in diverse colors from monochromatic to bright colors. One great exercise is to challenge yourself to find something you like in each room even if you don't particularly like a room--it can be a lamp, a rug, a pillow, or piece of art, but you begin articulating and stretching your taste.

Any intellectual viewer will see that the characters come directly out of Stereotypes 101 and the plots are nothing but recycled George Romero and countless other zombie films, but they always manage to put a story or photo of the series in every issue. Whomever thought that this was the best show ever on TV really needs to watch more TV. Even the worst episode of THE X-FILES makes the best episode of THE WALKING DEAD look like the worst episode of WHO'S THE BOSS. Just because a TV show has taboo-breaking gore on it does not make it a great series. What about M*A*S*H, THE WIRE, THE SOPRANOS, ST. ELSEWHERE, OZ, JUSTIFIED, THE AMERICANS, GAME OF THRONES, AMERICAN HORROR STORY or any other good show that made or makes TV worthwhile? To EW, they are nothing but chickenfeed when put next to THE WALKING DEAD. Like I said, that is really my only complaint about the magazine, but it is enough of an annoyance whenever I see I cover on the zine devoted to the show (and there have been many!). They do have a good staff of writers and make me laugh every now and then, so I give them a pass when it comes to TWD. It's a great zine at a very affordable price if you have it renewed every year. You pay like $0.49 an issue. A real bargain.",The Entertainment Bible.,1423180800,3,,magazine_subscriptions

It's a good balance of articles about interior decorating, landscaping and curb appeal, food and places to visit in the south. This magazine provides enough content that it takes me more than one sitting to finish it all, which I think is a good thing.

BTW, when I signed up for this magazine, I wasn't sure what they meant by ""southern"". Subsequently, I learned that this magazine caters to people as far north as Maryland. West Virginia is included too. In other words, this magazine caters to an audience that is wider than I first thought, which I think is a good thing.

I also like the current editor a lot - I think he does a good job of balancing the need to keep the magazine relevant / current with the desire to tie the new issues into the larger Southern Living legacy. He lets the magazine celebrate tradition without being overly stuffy or being overly resistant to change and/or modern tastes. In other words, the magazine keeps its unique voice but also stays fresh/current too.

One additional comment is that Southern Living always has lovely covers. I know its just the cover, but it always makes me want to dive right in and enjoy the rest of the issue! The covers are consistently beautiful and also do a good job of representing the content inside the magazine.",Great magazine! I love it!!,1375401600,3,,magazine_subscriptions

Keefer,"VERANDA reigns along with the other three most beautiful and stylish U.S. shelter magazines today: Architectural Digest, Elle Decor and House Beautiful. What I like about VERANDA is the photography and rooms dominate and the text takes a supporting role.  The magazine features many full-page and double-page spreads of gorgeous rooms with not a lot of text interrupting.  Design is one of the fields in which you can learn by just studying a room in detail to get a sense of the scale, proportion, balance of texture and light and shadow etc.

You are training your eye in what the best designers find beautiful.  A full and double-page spread allows you to do that better than smaller, choppier photos. It's great to have more visual, less words in which the rooms triumph. More to see--less to read. There's enough text in VERANDA to get into the designers'/homeowners' minds. VERANDA'S lush heavy paper stock is a joy, too, and increases the aesthetic experience.  The photos of the rooms look spectacular on it.

VERANDA features eclectic styles and locations.  This month, for example, the magazine showcases a townhouse in Georgetown, a Park Avenue apartment, a Parisian pied-a-terre, a Florida ocean-front home and a Normandy-inspired Atlanta home along with a Cotswold garden. There's a mix of styles from Provencal antiques to Art Deco to a soft, tailored modern. It's a monthly infusion of visual beauty and grace. (As an aside: I love buying my shelter magazines through Amazon as I've been able to get great subscription prices and track my subscriptions so I don't miss a single issue, which is helpful when you subscribe to lots of magazines.)

In the current issue I am reading (all magazines change their format over time), the first section is called ""Data"" and it covers the latest science news on a variety of topics. This is followed by section consisting of a series of articles each no more that several pages long. A favorite of mine is called ""Vital Signs"" which usually covers some intriguing, difficult to solve, true life medical mystery. This month's issue was about a 16-month old boy with a lemon-sized mass in his chest. A theme of this current issue is called ""The Cure"" involving a series of articles on possible cures on the horizon for AIDS, various vaccines for illnesses such as cancer, diabetes and allergies, and a very interesting article on Bio Hackers also known as do-it-yourself biology (DIYbio). These articles provided more in depth coverage of the material.

4.0,True,"04 8, 2011",A1GQAKL9CGQLP1,B00008RUJP,{'Format:': ' Print Magazine'},L. M. Keefer,"VERANDA reigns along with the other three most beautiful and stylish U.S. shelter magazines today: Architectural Digest, Elle Decor and House Beautiful. What I like about VERANDA is the photography and rooms dominate and the text takes a supporting role.  The magazine features many full-page and double-page spreads of gorgeous rooms with not a lot of text interrupting.  Design is one of the fields in which you can learn by just studying a room in detail to get a sense of the scale, proportion, balance of texture and light and shadow etc.

You are training your eye in what the best designers find beautiful.  A full and double-page spread allows you to do that better than smaller, choppier photos. It's great to have more visual, less words in which the rooms triumph. More to see--less to read. There's enough text in VERANDA to get into the designers'/homeowners' minds. VERANDA'S lush heavy paper stock is a joy, too, and increases the aesthetic experience.  The photos of the rooms look spectacular on it.

VERANDA features eclectic styles and locations.  This month, for example, the magazine showcases a townhouse in Georgetown, a Park Avenue apartment, a Parisian pied-a-terre, a Florida ocean-front home and a Normandy-inspired Atlanta home along with a Cotswold garden. There's a mix of styles from Provencal antiques to Art Deco to a soft, tailored modern. It's a monthly infusion of visual beauty and grace. (As an aside: I love buying my shelter magazines through Amazon as I've been able to get great subscription prices and track my subscriptions so I don't miss a single issue, which is helpful when you subscribe to lots of magazines.)

My roommates sigh everytime they check the mail because they inevitably have to carry home heavy piles of glossy paper encased in plastic wrap. Marie Claire is probably my favorite magazine out of all the ones I read (I read most fashion and women's health magazines) because it provides a bit of everything that the average young professional woman like myself enjoys. Some of its interest pieces about real life people are thought-provoking and well-written. There is almost always a feature article about some celebrity, but Marie Claire takes the time to interview the celebrity and try to get a different perspective on her life.

Elle Decor delivers. I anticipate its arrival each month. The magazine is great for training your eye as to what's interesting, stylish and beautiful in today's design world. If you are wanting to update any tired and boring rooms in your home, or rooms you're bored with, it's great for showing you what's new or being reinterpreted in a fresh way.  Then you can pick and choose what appeals to you.

Taste is about exposure and Elle Decor exposes you to what top designers are doing today so you can incorporate the elements you like in your own home. It features all kinds of rooms and styles in diverse colors from monochromatic to bright colors. One great exercise is to challenge yourself to find something you like in each room even if you don't particularly like a room--it can be a lamp, a rug, a pillow, or piece of art, but you begin articulating and stretching your taste.

However, the 2015 Investment Guide Special Issue of Forbes Road Map To Riches; Your 32 Best Investment Ideas are also a treasure trove of a variety of information.  25 years of guaranteed income starts on page 108, buying a house in the suburbs page 120,  feature on investors and African economies starts on page 125, a feature on Brazil and their booming beauty business  starts on page 172, and a feature on umberto angeloni listed to be fashions comeback king and based out of Italy starts on page 178. Im also holding a special edition of Forbes that has the listing of the Forbes 400 (listed to be the identitive randking of the richest people in America) that was listed for display until January 5, 2015. Jerry yang is on the front of the cover and there is a feature listed to be a scorecard consisting of men and women who are self-made and those who are silver spoon.  An article on Business Aviation (pages  117-122), pages  130-132 feature the rankings of the 15th to the 19th richest people in America, and pages 168-174 feature the  167th to 190th richest. Forbes also has other special edition magazines such as the 2015 Investment Guide Special Issue of the Road Map To Riches titled Your Best 32 Investment Investment Ideas and listed to Display Until March 16, 2015. The Leader Board (page 32) and 25 Years of Guaranteed Income (starts on page 108) are some of the article features with the Forbes Special issue 2015 Investment Guide. As mentioned in a previous review, I would be fine with being employed until Im at least 85. The only reason why my husband and I are already planning to save enough money to comfortably retire by the late 2030s/early2040s is because of our shared belief that social security in the U.S. will not pay enough for even a cheap apartment  by the time the late 2040s/early 2050s roll around. Additionally, we are both aware that were part of a generation where retirement accounts are our responsibility, self-employment may be necessary and not just a take it or leave it option, and also preparing for the possibility of age related discrimination still existing for both the male and female genders of all races/ethnicities (especially with me being a minority woman).",Special 2015 issue of Forbes,1420675200,2,,magazine_subscriptions
